# Psychometric-Tools-STATA
This project aims to develop new function for psychometric using STATA statistical software

Firsty, the project proposes function for Partial Credit Model using Rasch mesurement theory

Especialy to estimate Weighted Likelihood Estimates (Warm 1989) 

Secondly, the project gives function and algorithm to find and resolve Differential Item Functioning and Response Shift using standardized residuals
